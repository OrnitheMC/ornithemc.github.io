      <p>
        Where FabricMC and QuiltMC keep up with the latest Minecraft versions,
        Ornithe fills a void by enabling the use of the Fabric and Quilt mod
        loaders on old Minecraft versions. On top of that, it provides other
        tools to enhance the mod development process, ranging from high-quality
        mappings to more obscure Java bytecode patches that aid developers in
        understanding and working with the Minecraft codebase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ornithe supports a wide range of Minecraft versions, from the earliest
        versions of the pre-classic era up to release 1.14.4, including snapshots
        and April Fools versions. It aims to support all possible versions within
        this range, even as once-lost versions are found and archived. This makes
        Ornithe a powerful tool in uncovering and understanding the history of
        Minecraft development.
